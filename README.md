# Space Station 2023

## Unity 3D

## I used to play a game at Chuck-e-cheese with my child. It was 4 player, the monitor was facing up.  When you put a coin in the machine on your side a missle would launch at a space station.  If you got past the shield and hit the core you would win tickets.  I wanted to make a clone of that using Unity 3D.
